# Frontend skeleton (plan)

- Tech: Vite + React + TypeScript
- Routes: `/`, `/chat`, `/lesson`, `/parent`, `/safety`
- Components: Card, StoryPanel, BottomNav, SSEClient
- SSE client: fetch + ReadableStream, backoff reconnect, cancel

Implementation will be added in a later branch with E2E tests aligned to docs/tdd-review-plan.md.
